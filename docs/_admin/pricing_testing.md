# Testing

To try the pricing in action, you can use a pricing debug tool. Open a new order page and enter the delivery details and see (1) which pricing rules were evaluated for each point/task and on an entire order (with rules that matched displayed in green) and (2) how the final price was calculated based on the matched rules.
