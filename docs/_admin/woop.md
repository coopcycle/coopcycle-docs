Configuring Woop
================

For CoopCycle to be able to respond to Woop quote requests, you need to configure an integration, to define the constraints (zone, weight…) and calculate a price.

Navigate to `Deliveries > Integrations > Woopit`, and click on the `Add` button at the top right.

⚠️ Make sure to ask Woop the "store identifier" that they will send in their requests.
