## Connect with Stripe

In the **Payment** section you will find two **Connect with Stripe** buttons. One for **Test** and another for **Live** mode. You should connect **Test** mode first and make Test payments to make sure the Restaurant and Stripe account of the restaurant are configured correctly. 

Go to [Creating a Stripe account](/en/admin/restaurants/creating-a-restaurant/#creating-a-stripe-account) to begin setting up the account.

To know more about **Test** (how to make Test payments) and **Live** mode go [here](/en/payment_processors/stripe/#what-is-the-live-mode-and-test-mode-of-stripe)

### Allow restaurant to set up their Stripe account
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
This option should be enabled only if the restaurant owner already has a Stripe account and if they know how to set up <strong>Test</strong> and <strong>Live</strong> mode. However, it is preferrable if the coop sets up the restaurant Stripe's account. 
</div>

When enabled this option makes the **Payment** section visible on the restaurant's owner account. Meaning they will be able to connect Stripe themselves. The option is disabled by default.
