# Admin's guide

---

Welcome to the administrator's guide for the CoopCycle platform.

Our software is a complete logistics and e-commerce system allowing the delivery of a product from A to B. Our platform is dedicated to bicycle delivery and its license is designed to reserve the use for worker owned co-operatives only.

The platform is composed of two components:

## Logistics

Pickup and dropoff management organised into a task system (two tasks form a delivery) allowing the following user actions:

- The **administrator**:
  - can assign tasks or task lists to a courier.
  - can track the position of a courier in real time from the dispatch (dashboard) screen; assigning tasks can be done the day before or in real time.
  - can manage pricing for stores (by weight, distance, zone, type of bike).
- The **courier**:

  - will receive the tasks on their smartphone (iOS and Android).
  - can mark a task as completed or failed and can add a comment.

- The **customer**:
  - can place an order on the platform and pay (price calculation is automated and secured through Stripe).

## E-commerce

Management of restaurants and shops, allowing the following user actions:

- The **customer**:

  - can place an order via the platform (website) or via the smartphone application.
  - can place an order from a restaurant, by inputing their address and selecting a delivery time.

- The **business**:
  - receives the order in real time, they can then accept or reject it.
  - can mark the order as ready, in this case the courier is notified.
  - can manage their menu online.

## Admin access

Having admin access means your local coop has an instance on the CoopCycle platform (e.g.: https://awesomecoop.coopcycle.org)

If you have admin access it means your user account on your [CoopCycle](https://coopcycle.org/en/) instance has been given admin privileges by the developer.

## Admin privileges

Admin privileges means you have full control over your CoopCycle instance.

Check the sub-categories under **Admin** to learn more about your instance.
