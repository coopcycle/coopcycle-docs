### **Very Complete But Complex Pricing** <span class="badge badge-success">**Recommended if Possible**</span>

Rates based on many characteristics, attempting to have a rule that will apply to as many types of clients possible in as many parts of the city as possible.

<span class="badge badge-info">EXAMPLE:</span> <span>This is when a cooperative works over a large geographic area, uses zones to reflect distances instead of kilometers, and has clients with a wide variety of services they might request. An example of this could be a bakery that has regular deliveries of large quantities of bread to local shops and points of sale in the morning, but then also has irregular deliveries of gift baskets throught the week of varying sizes. A single pricing rule will have to reflect multiple types of services, many different areas, and once it has been completed, it may make sense to use for many different shops and thereby standarize the commercial, delivery, and invoicing tasks. <span>

<span class="badge badge-primary">FORMAT:</span> <span>A pricing rule of this type will often combine base prices to move between zones, plus weight and volume supplements, plus charges that relate to how urgent a delivery is and to how much advance warning the delivery is made. <span>

<span class="badge badge-success">When to use</span> <span>Clients who have many different types of deliveries, multiple pickup locations in different parts of the city. Bakeries, florists, other types of local commerce. **Pros:** Can be used to make a standard pricing rule that simplifies commercial capture and operations, is more "fair" and precise<span>

<span class="badge badge-danger">When **not** to use</span> <span>A simple client who wants a simple price they understand and will be put off by math and large tables **Cons:** Can confuse small business owners and make the commercial process harder. The more complex a rule gets, the harder it is to modify later.<span>
