### **Old School Bike Messenger Pricing**

Rates based on kilometers, with supplemental charges based on weight and other characteristics.

<span class="badge badge-info">EXAMPLE:</span> <span>A fruit shop that has a dozen orders a week, and has 3 sizes of fruit boxes with different weights that are charged differently. These clients get a call from their own client, open CoopCycle, and make the order while talking to their client over the phone in order to charge the final client a part of the CoopCycle delivery fee based on the calculation they see in the website. This could also be lawyers, clothing shops, or any other type of small local commerce with unpredictable but constant deliveries. <span>

<span class="badge badge-primary">FORMAT:</span> <span>A pricing rule of this type will usually have a km-based rule, plus supplemental charges for extra weight or volume. <span>

<span class="badge badge-success">When to use</span> <span>When you have clients who have deliveries that may go to any place in the city in unpredictable ways, so you must default to km-based pricing rules. **Pros:** Simple, can't accidentally give a wrong price, easy for clients to understand<span>

<span class="badge badge-danger">When **not** to use</span> <span>If you can avoid it, do. Do not use if you have any type of client other than that described above. **Cons:** This pricing rule is easy, but cannot be used for deliveries with multiple points since they will be charged more or less based on if they order the deliveries efficiently or not, which is not their concern. It also imagines you are only delivering their package, and not mixing with other clients in an effective way. Effectively, this is a pricing rule made for a type of delivery that is not longer common or strategically interesting for your business, creating unintended limitations long-term.<span>
