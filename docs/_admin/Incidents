# Introduction
Incidents are a fact of life in logistics. Things break, things get lost, things arrive later than expected, clients decide that two boxes are actually one (oops!), the list goes on forever. Managing these incidents is a key part of your branding and service quality. Imagining that you will simply not have incidents is unrealistic, we must plan for accidents and mistakes and create effective protocols that allow us to keep clients happy with our service. The goals of this section are:
1. Best practices for incident management as an organization
2. Explain the workflow that CoopCycle's software uses to manage incidents in Local Commerce and Last Mile services
3. Explain how to set up personalized incident management on your instance of CoopCycle
