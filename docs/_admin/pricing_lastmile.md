### **Last Mile At Volume**

Simple rates made for a client that gives you a large volume of orders with relatively standardized characteristics.

<span class="badge badge-info">EXAMPLE:</span> <span>This is usually when a large entity requests that a cooperative delivers 50+ of a standarized item like a magazine over the course of multiple days. <span>

<span class="badge badge-primary">FORMAT:</span> <span>This often is a price that is a simple price per point that reflets an average that both sides agree is equitable. The client likely uses an excel to upload their large list of tasks. <span>

<span class="badge badge-success">When to use</span> <span>For clients who give you a high volume of standarized packages such as magazines, small last mile pacakges from a provider like DHL, or any other delivery that can easily have an "average" price. **Pros:** Simple for client and invoicing. <span>

<span class="badge badge-danger">When **not** to use</span> <span>Any client with deliveries that cannot be "averaged" **Cons:** If your average is wrong, later you will have made less money than you hope. Maybe the client says they have a simple and easily averaged need, but then ask for special or different deliveries in specific moment that should be more expensive, but the rule charges the "cheap" option. <span>
