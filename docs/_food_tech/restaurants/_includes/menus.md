This is the Drag & Drop menu editor. When saving your first Menu, the <strong>Active menu</strong> setting will show on the top Restaurant settings. By clicking on it it will open the Menu Editor on the currenty activated menu. 
</div>  

**The editor is made up of two sections**:

1. On  the left-hand side you can arrange the menu that will be displayed to customers. First of all you need to create a **section** (also called **category**) in order to Drag & Drop products. Examples of categories: `Main dish`, `Snacks`, `Beverages`, `Alcohol`.


2. On the right-hand side are **all** the Products you have created.   

To add a category click <span class="badge badge-success"> <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Add</span> and a pop-up will prompt you into writing a name for your category. Click <span class="badge badge-primary">Save</span>.  
You can add as many categories as you need.

To place Products inside Categories, Drag & Drop a product from the right on top of a Category on the left. You can also Drag & Drop a Product from a Category back into the Products section on the right. The arrangement of Products and Categories is how it will be displayed to the customer. 

Categories can be shifted up and down by holding left-click on the top grey bar of the category name. They can be shifted regardless of containing products or not. 

Once you finished setting up the Menu on the left section, click <span class="badge badge-primary">Save changes.</span>

<span class="badge badge-info">IMPORTANT:</span><span> The Menu is not yet visible on the Homepage of the Restaurant. In order to display the menu you need to go to the main <span><i class="fa fa-list" aria-hidden="true"></i> Menus</span> page and click <span class="badge badge-success"> <i class="fa fa-check"></i> Activate</span>.</span>

You can create multiple menus but can only activate one menu at a time. Only menus that are idle (not activated) can be deleted with <span class="badge badge-danger"><i class="fa fa-trash-o"></i></span>.
