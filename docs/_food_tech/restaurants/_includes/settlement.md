## Contract

<span class="badge badge-info">TIP:</span><span> The following settings should be configured for both <strong>Enable variable amount paid by the customer</strong></span>
### Selecting `No`

The default option is `no` and will allow you to use a fixed amount when charging the customer the delivery fee. 

**Amount charged by the platform** is the fixed delivery fee that the Coop will receive (the platform being the Coop).  
**Amount paid by the customer** is the fixed delivery fee that the Customer will pay when ordering.

There are two ways this can be configured.
#### Option 1:
If the **Amount charged by the platform** is equal to the **Amount paid by the customer** it means the customer gets charged a certain fee and the Coop receives that exact fee.

|Charged by the platform|Paid by the customer|Coop receives|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|5|5|**5**|

#### Option 2:

If the **Amount charged by the platform** is higher than the **Amount paid by the customer** it means the Restaurant pays the difference between the platform and the customer fee.

|Charged by the platform|Paid by the customer|Paid by the Restaurant|Coop receives|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|5|2|3|**5**|

<span class="badge badge-info">TIP:</span><span> This option allows for Restaurants to sponsor the Customers by offering their products at a smaller delivery fee.</span>

### Selecting `Yes`

Selecting `yes` will allow you to use a custom delivery pricing. This can be configured [here](/en/admin/deliveries/pricing/).

After you've configured the pricing use the dropdown menu to select it. *Make sure to select the same pricing* under both **Amount charged by the platform** and **Amount paid by the customer**.
