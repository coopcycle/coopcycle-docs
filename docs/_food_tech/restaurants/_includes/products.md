| Price (tax excl.) | Price (tax incl.) |         Taxes         |
| :---------------: | :---------------: | :-------------------: |
|         2         |         2         | Select a tax category |

Under Options you should see the newly created Option called `Sauces`.
By checking ☑️ the box next to the name it will make it visible to Customers. When a Customer clicks on the product which has an Option appended to it, this option will be displayed in a pop-up where the Customer can choose between the different sauces.

<span class="badge badge-primary">TIP:</span><span> You can create multiple Options, and you can append any combination you want under one Product.</span>
