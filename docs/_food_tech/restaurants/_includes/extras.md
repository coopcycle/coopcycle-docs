#### **Name**

When this setting is left unchecked ⬜️ the customer can select only one (1) out of multiple extras.  

When this setting is checked ☑️ the customer can choose a specific amount per each extra. Checking this option will display a new setting next to the Preview pane. 

#### **Min. number and Max. number**
