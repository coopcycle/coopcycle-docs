Each **order** consists of a minimum of two **tasks** that a dispatcher assigns to a courier.

When the order is created, the dispatcher assigns the Pickup and Dropoff tasks manually in the most optimal order that they judge. The creation of an order is materialized on the map by means of a GPS track which is proposed to the courier for delivery.
