# Order

There are two types of orders :

- [Foodtech (restaurant's) orders](/en/food-tech/orders): engaged by end customers on the platform.
- [Delivery orders](/en/web/admin/deliveries): : a pricing rule is applied to the delivery and we calculate the price thanks to the pricing rule linked to the store.
They can be created : by end customers via the integrated form, by store owners via their account on the website or the mobile app, by admins, imported via CSV/Excel files, added via APIs.
