## Delay

The delay means "A rider can not pickup things in the next 30min". The restaurant owner has his own delay (rush mode) which means "I can not start preparing an order in the next Xmin" (for now 25min).
So if prep time is 20min, a restaurant set rush mode (+25min) and dispatcher set a 20min delay. Then restaurant and dispatch are operating with the same "lateness", then the customer is just delayed 25min not 25min + 20min.
