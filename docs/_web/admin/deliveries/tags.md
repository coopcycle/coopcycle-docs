# Tags

<div class="alert mt-3 alert-info" role="alert">
Tags can be used as specific short descriptions of tasks. They can be applied manually to tasks or assigned to a Store where all tasks created for that Store will automatically get the assigned tag attached.
</div>

On the Tags main page a list of all available tags will be displayed.

In order to create a new tag click <span class="badge badge-success"> <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> Create new tag</span> 

Tags are composed of a **Name** and a **Colour**.
## Name

## Color

Select a colour for the tag.  
You can select it from the color-picker, by inserting a HEX or RGBA colour code or selecting a predefined colour.

Once you've set up the tag click <span class="badge badge-primary">Save</span>.
