# Task

A **task** is the smallest unit of work. Pick or drop something (packages) at some place in a given time window.

There are **two** types of tasks:
- **Pickup**
- **Dropoff**

Tasks statuses are:
- To-do 
- Cancelled / cancellado / annul√©e
- Finished / terminado / completado

On the CoopCycle platform, tasks exists within a delivery (list of tasks to execute in order). Creating tasks as standalone units is deprecated.
