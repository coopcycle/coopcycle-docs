There are two types of orders :

- [Foodtech (restaurant's) orders](/en/food-tech/orders): created by end customers on the platform.
- [Package delivery ('last mile') orders](/en/package-delivery/orders): created by store owners via their account on the website or the mobile app, by admins, by end customers via the integrated form, imported via CSV/Excel files, added via APIs.

Each **order** is linked to **delivery**.
