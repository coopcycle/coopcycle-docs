## Tasks and Orders

### Tasks
A **task** is the smallest unit of a delivery order.\
A **task** is a To-Do unit under a specific address and a set timeframe.

There are **two** types of tasks:
- **Pickup** or Collection
- **Dropoff** or Delivery

Each **order** consists of a minimum of two **tasks** that a dispatcher assigns to a courier.

#### Pickup and Dropoff

The following information must be completed by the dispatcher for each task:
- Address
- Time range 
- Commentary

The following information is used to track the progress of a task in the delivery process:

- Status
- History
The courier must pick up merchandise at an address and bring it to another address. 

## Orders

Assign two or more tasks to a delivery person creating a delivery. When the Retrieve and Drop tasks are created, the dispatcher assigns these tasks manually in the most optimal order that they judge. The creation of a delivery is materialized on the map by means of a GPS track which is proposed to the courier for delivery.
