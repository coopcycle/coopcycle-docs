### Debugging Bluetooth devices

If you Bluetooth printer is not recognized, it helps if you can debug the device capabilities.

To do so, install the [nRF Connect for Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp) app on Google Play.

Once installed, launch the app, and scan for devices.
When your device is detected, tap on "CONNECT".
