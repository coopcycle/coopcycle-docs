# Admin's guide

Welcome to the administrator's guide for the CoopCycle platform.

Our software is a complete logistics and e-commerce system allowing the delivery of a product from A to B. Our platform is dedicated to bicycle delivery and its license is designed to reserve the use for worker owned co-operatives only.

The platform is composed of two components:

## Logistics
Pickup and dropoff management organised into a task system (two tasks form a delivery) allowing the following user actions:

- The **administrator**:
  - can assign tasks or task lists to a courier.
  - can track the position of a courier in real time from the dispatch (dashboard) screen; assigning tasks can be done the day before or in real time.
  - can manage pricing for stores (by weight, distance, zone, type of bike).
  
- The **courier**:
  - will receive the tasks on their smartphone (iOS and Android).
  - can mark a task as completed or failed and can add a comment.

- The **customer**:
  - can place an order on the platform and pay (price calculation is automated and secured through Stripe).

## E-commerce
Management of restaurants and shops, allowing the following user actions:

- The **customer**: 
  - can place an order via the platform (website) or via the smartphone application.
  - can place an order from a restaurant, by inputing their address and selecting a delivery time.

- The **business**: 
  - receives the order in real time, they can then accept or reject it.
  - can mark the order as ready, in this case the courier is notified.
  - can manage their menu online.
